# ansible-speedcam

This is my ansible playbook to set up my speedcam pi. It uses Claude Pageau's Speed-Camera project(https://github.com/pageauc/speed-camera).

Requirements
* ansible
* [ansible needs python](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) so it is also required

Run
```
ansible-playbook speedcam.yml
```
